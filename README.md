While eye-witness identification appears to be a simple and effective tool for investigators, a large body of empirical research has revealed the validity of an identification can be compromised by many different factors. As a consequence, 77% of the first 225 cases of DNA-based exonerations of wrongful convictions involved some form of eye-witness misidentification. Fortunately, the research on this topic has also provided a wealth of information on how to improve the accuracy of eye-witness identifications.

Many policy-makers have made it a priority to improve the administration of identification procedures by requiring use of the best practices identified through the research. However, the research can be very fine-grained and complicated. As the Wisconsin Attorney General explained in his attempt to provide guidelines on the best identification procedures:

> _No one document can address all the circumstances and/or exigencies that are encountered in the field. This model and guidelines are not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of all of the factors involved in criminal investigation. Rather, it is a general policy and procedural guide outlining methods for collecting and preserving evidence. Readers should keep in mind that the information and procedures presented here are intended to be used as guidelines when encountering circumstances and factors not specifically covered._

Evidence-based guidelines are certainly better than nothing, but where they fall short it is left to the officer to determine how best to apply the mountains of technical research to their given circumstances in order to produce the best possible identification. Even if a user is somehow able to apply all the available research to their given situation, the resulting procedure may require resources that are not available to the user. The iWitness program is designed to address both of these problems. 

## Elements of the iWitness Identification Program

At its core, the iWitness program is intended to be a smartphone-based facilitated decision-making tool for those seeking to conduct eye-witness identifications in accordance with the most rigorous and current research available.

By providing a user-friendly interface for the underlying evidence-based programing, iWitness is meant to only require users to input the minimally necessary information in order to automatically generate the best evidence-based identification procedures for the given circumstances. Afterwards, the smartphone would then be handed to the witness where iWitness would administer the entire line-up procedure according to the research. Once the witness was finished, iWitness would provide the officer with the results of the identification.

In addition to facilitating procedures that users are already expected to follow, the smartphone-based iWitness program creates the possibility of even further improving identification procedures beyond what is currently possible. For instance, users could administer line-ups to witnesses speaking languages they do not know themselves. Additionally, lineups could be administered onsite, rather than at the station. Ultimately, the iWitness program would allow 1) fewer FTEs 2) to do a better job 3) in less time.

## Background and Status

The source code currently contained in this repo is an early prototype for the app's front end. The prototype was written in objective-C built for an old version of iOS. Development of the code was supported by a philanthropic foundation and written by a commercial software firm.

Since that time, the foundation gifted the source code to the Urban Institute to make it possible to update, improve, conduct a pilot study, and make the software available for regular use in the justice system. Urban is currently seeking resources to accomplish these objectives.
